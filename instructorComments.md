INSTRUCTOR COMMENTS
===================

Good to have this turned in, yes?! :)

It's not uncommon to have similar looking programs with other students
when the program is very short. For an extensive program like this, a
few more differences are expected to be evident, even if the basic 
gameplay is the same. Your program is identical in structure to a couple
of other programs in here.

You (and they) need to take measures to avoid that occurrence happening
in the future.
